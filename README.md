A small shortcodes plugin that contains only the shortcodes that we have found most essential to include on our clients websites to reduce bloat.

## Description ##
The Ilmenite Shortcodes plugin is a small shortcodes plugin that contains only the shortcodes that we have found most essential to include on our clients websites.

We do not aim to make this plugin the ultimate shortcodes plugin out there with dozens of shortcodes that are rarely used. Instead, this plugin should contain only some of the more useful little shortcodes that we find a need for over and over again.

## Installation ##
1. Upload the ilmenite-shortcodes directory to your wp-content/plugins/ directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
